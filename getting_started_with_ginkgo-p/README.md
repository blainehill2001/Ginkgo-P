## Here's a quick introduction to the Custom Algorithm functionality of Ginkgo-P

Step 1.) Either git clone Ginkgo-P and run `npm run dev` to start the system locally, or [visit Ginkgo-P here](https://ginkgo-p.onrender.com/).

Step 2.) Under the "Run Custom KG Algorithm" tab, upload the `ExamplePythonScript.py` file under the Script Upload section.

Step 3.) Upload both `ExampleTextFile1.txt` and `ExampleTextFile2.txt` using [Command/Control + clicks](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/select-items-mchlp1378/mac#:~:text=Select%20multiple%20items%3A%20Press%20and,are%20included%20in%20the%20selection.) under the Data Upload section.

Step 4.) Plug in your Email Address under the Email Upload section.

Step 5.) Wait for your algorithm to finish, and check your email! Don't forget to check your spam, due to overzealous email providers.
